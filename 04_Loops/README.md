## 📂 File Overview  

| No. | File Name | Description |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | **01_For_Loop_use_i++.c** | Demonstrates increment (`i++`) and decrement (`i--`) operations, prints numbers in ascending and descending order, and calculates the sum from 1 to 10. |
| 2️⃣ | **02_Print_Number_1_to_100.c** | Prints numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop. |
