# 🔁 04_Loops — Iteration and Repetition in C  

This folder contains programs demonstrating **looping constructs** in C — how to repeat a block of code multiple times efficiently using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## 📂 File Overview  

| No. | File Name | Description |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | **01_For_Loop_use_i++.c** | Demonstrates increment (`i++`) and decrement (`i--`) operations, prints numbers in ascending and descending order, and calculates the sum from 1 to 10. |
| 2️⃣ | **02_Print_Number_1_to_100.c** | Prints numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop. |
| 3️⃣ | **03_while_loop_practice.c** | Demonstrates practical use of `while` loops — printing messages, generating tables of 2 and 3, and calculating the sum of the first five numbers. |
| 4️⃣ | **04_print_1_to_10.c** | Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop. Demonstrates simple iteration logic and loop control. |

## 🖥️ How to Run  

Compile and execute any program using:  
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

💻 **Tools Used**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| 🧠 **VS Code** | For writing & debugging code |
| 🖥️ **GCC Compiler** | To compile and run C programs |
| 🐙 **Git & GitHub** | For version control and sharing projects |
| 📘 **Markdown** | For writing README documentation |

🔰 **Tips for Beginners**

✨ Start small — understand how each loop (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) works.  
⚙️ Always dry-run your loop logic on paper before running it.  
🔄 Experiment with increment/decrement operators (`i++`, `i--`).  
🧩 Add print statements to trace variable values inside loops.  
💪 Practice pattern problems — they improve your logic building.
