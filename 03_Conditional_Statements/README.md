# ‚öôÔ∏è 03_Conditional_Statements ‚Äî Decision Making in C  

This folder contains programs that demonstrate the use of **conditional statements** in C programming such as `if`, `if-else`, `nested if`, and `switch-case`.  
These programs help in understanding how to make decisions in code based on conditions and logical flow.
