## 🔰 Tips for Beginners

- ✍️ Type each program manually — repetition builds logic.  
- ⚙️ Focus on **understanding flow**, not memorizing syntax.  
- 🔍 Predict program output before running — sharpens analytical thinking.  
- 🧩 Debug errors yourself before searching online — it builds confidence.  
- 💡 Once you understand the basics, try combining multiple concepts in one program.
