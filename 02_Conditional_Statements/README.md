# ⚙️ 02_Conditional_Statements — Decision Making in C

This folder contains C programs focused on **decision-making statements** — the backbone of logic building in programming.  
These programs demonstrate the use of `if`, `else if`, `nested if`, and `switch` constructs for solving real-world problems through condition checks and branching logic.

## 🔰 Tips for Beginners

✍️ Write each program manually — repetition improves logic.  
⚙️ Focus on understanding the flow of conditions, not memorizing syntax.  
🔍 Predict outputs before running your code — sharpen problem-solving skills.  
🧩 Debug errors yourself before searching online — builds real confidence.  
💡 Try combining multiple condition checks into one practical program.
