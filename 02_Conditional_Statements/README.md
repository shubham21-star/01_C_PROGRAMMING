# ⚙️ 03_Conditional_Statements — Decision Making in C  

This folder contains programs that demonstrate the use of **conditional statements** in C programming such as `if`, `if-else`, `nested if`, and `switch-case`.  
These programs help in understanding how to make decisions in code based on conditions and logical flow.

## 📂 File Overview  

| No. | File Name | Description |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | **01_If_Else_Multiple_Condition_Tests.c** | Tests for divisibility (5 & 11, 3 & 7), leap year, vowel/consonant, and positive/negative number checks using `if-else`. |
| 2️⃣ | **02_Nested_If_Without_Logical_Operators.c** | Demonstrates nested `if` statements without using logical operators — checks user ID, password, age, and grade eligibility. |
| 3️⃣ | **03_Electric_Bill_Using_If_Else.c** | Calculates an electric bill based on the number of units consumed using tier-based `if-else` logic. |
| 4️⃣ | **04_Switch_Case_Day_of_Week.c** | Uses a `switch-case` statement to display the day of the week (1–7). |
| 5️⃣ | **05_Switch_Case_Input_Menu.c** | Implements a simple calculator using `switch-case` for basic arithmetic operations. |

## 🔰 Tips for Beginners  

- 💡 Understand the **flow of conditions** — how `if`, `else if`, and `else` execute.  
- 🔄 Try writing **nested if** and **ladder if-else** examples yourself.  
- 🧠 Always dry-run conditions on paper to check logic before execution.  
- 🧩 Practice real-life examples (like marksheet, billing, eligibility check).
